THIS MUST BE RUN ON MACOS

*also note that any messages sent, will depend on the apple account that is signed in on the mac that is being used.

The parameters to run PHONE_NUMBER and MESSAGE_TO_SEND can be set in config.py
The only other requirement to run is that the text file that is being sent must be in the same folder as main.py.
