# Text_Spam
Takes a target phone number and target text file and sends the content, separated by whitespace, one text message at a time to the target phone number.

The parameters to run PHONE_NUMBER and MESSAGE_TO_SEND can be set in config.py
The only other requirement to run is that the text file that is being sent must be in the same folder as main.py.
